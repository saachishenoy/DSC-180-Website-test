        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project addresses the challenge of navigating the vast amount of information on the internet to retrieve historically relevant and accurate data. By leveraging a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that combines search algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs), our model searches, retrieves, and synthesizes data from historical news sources to respond to user queries with nuanced insights.</p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Our methodology involves preprocessing newspaper data, storing it efficiently, and implementing a two-tiered search and retrieval process. Initial methods utilized BERT embeddings and FAISS indices, while improvements led to adopting Sentence Transformers for more efficient processing and Chroma databases for scalable storage. Our final responses are generated by the LLamas LLM, optimized for answering complex historical queries.</p>
